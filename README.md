# ZeroTolerance
This is (or will be) a collection of single header file libraries for C/C++ development, with a focus on games.

What's with the name "Zero Tolerance?"
	I chose the name because my goal is to have a zero tolerance policy for slow, bloated software, slow compile times, and long development time.  I want this library to be fast in execution, fast in compile times and fast and easy to use.

Special Thanks
	This library is inspired by the single file libraries by Sean Barrett.  Inspiration has also been drawn from Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero video series as well as Shawn McGrath's programming streams.
